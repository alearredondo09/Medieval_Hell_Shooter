**Medieval Hell Shooter** is a bullet-shooting simulation game.  
The main focus is to simulate intense projectile patterns from enemy spawners.

- The boss spawns bullets using spawner prefabs.
- Spawners are shield sprites that act as bullets.
- Various bullet patterns are implemented, such as:
  - Straight
  - Snake
  - Spin
- Implemented this way to allow spawner rotation independently of the boss, so bullets can be emitted at multiple angles.
